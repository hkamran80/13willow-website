- **Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers**

    We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("**third parties**") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. The third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:

    | Third Party                                             | Purpose(s)                                                     | Platforms          |

- **Business Transfers**

## How Long Do We Keep Your Information?

*TL;DR — We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.*

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section ["How Can You Contact Us About This Notice?" section](#how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice) below.

## Controls for Do-Not-Track Features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

## Do California Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?

*TL;DR — Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.*

To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).

### Your rights with respect to your personal data

- **Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete**

    You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

- **Right to be informed — Request to know**

    Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:

  - whether we collect and use your personal information;
  - the categories of personal information that we collect;
  - the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;
  - whether we sell your personal information to third parties;
  - the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose;
  - the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and
  - the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.

  In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.

- **Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights**

  We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.

- **Verification process**

  Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

  We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

- **Other privacy rights**

  - You may object to the processing of your personal information.

  - You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.

  - You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.

  - You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.

To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at [hkamran@13willow.com](mailto:hkamran@13willow.com?subject=Questions%20About%20the%20Privacy%20Policy), or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.
