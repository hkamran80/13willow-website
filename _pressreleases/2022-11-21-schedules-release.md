LAFAYETTE, Nov. 21, 2022 — Thirteenth Willow today announced the release of Schedules
for web, iOS, and Android users. The service tells users which period they are
currently in, what the next period is, how much time is remaining in the current
period, and the next period’s starting time. Schedules currently only supports
school bell schedules that are the same for all students in the school. Schools
where the times of individual class periods may change student to student are
not yet supported.

To request a schedule, users can go to [https://go.unisontech.org/schreq](https://go.unisontech.org/schreq),
to have their schedule added to the system by a developer, with all bell schedules
verified by Thirteenth Willow.

No personal data is collected in Schedules. Users can choose to opt in to error
and performance monitoring software Sentry.io on the mobile app only.

Schedules is entirely open-source, and entirely free with no ads, subscriptions,
or in-app purchases. The source code is available on GitHub. For web, [https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules).
For mobile, [https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules-flutter](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules-flutter).
