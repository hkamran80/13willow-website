                                verify your identity to determine you are the
                                same person about whom we have the information
                                in our system. These verification efforts
                                require us to ask you to provide information so
                                that we can match it with information you have
                                previously provided us. For instance, depending
                                on the type of request you submit, we may ask
                                you to provide certain information so that we
                                can match the information you provide with the

                                dictate.
